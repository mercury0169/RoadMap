# hello-world
just practising git
My name is Vitaliy. I am data analyst and want to start using Git. I am not doing any coding except my jupyter notebooks for data analysis, i want to keep em all in here

Here i want to keep my personal roadmap: courses, videos, books, project and so on
I think it is the good way to structurize all the information i have absorbed during my study

## SQL section
1. I have already accomplished free course on Stepik.org called 'Интерактивный тренажор по SQL'
   https://stepik.org/cert/905950
   The course is based on the following principle: less theory, more practise
   Each section starts from the introduction of Database (you explore what tables are in there, what columns they have and so on)
   Then lesson by lesson you learn from Select to some Window functions.
   It's good that course is full of exercises but after i finished i realized: i know how to solve, but for some methods i have poor understanding of how it works. Still it was usefull. Comment section is very helpful: people who also studied this course come up with some interesting queries and you are free to try them all.
2. Currently i am trying SQL tutorial by MODE
   (https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)
   It is free text tutorial of SQl by MODE. The course is devided by 4 sections: basic, intermediate, advaced and analytics training.
   Mode offer you their own platform (like text editor). It already has all the databases you need, so you can freely practise exersices there, run your queries and check results. Also you can check the solution as well.
   
   notes: Venn diagramm isn't a good way to explain SQL joins. A more apposite visual representation might be this:
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13997365/sql-joins-as-venn-diagram
          Another one with Venn diagramm and exempls:
            https://joins.spathon.com/
   
   

#To_try:
   sql-ex.ru (with preinstalled Postgre)
   https://pgexercises.com/ (Postgre exercises)
   https://sqlzoo.net/ (sql exercises)
   
## Python section
1. 'Programming on Python' is very easy introductory couse which only gives the basis. 
    https://stepik.org/course/67/syllabus
    At least it makes it comfortable for you to read the Python code and understand how some funtioncs work

#To_try:
   https://pythontutor.ru/ - Course on Python
   https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python - Python for everybody
   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQfwKTJdCmiA6cXAY0PNRJw - MIT video lectures by Timofei Hiryanov


## Statistics
1. Of course, Statistics from Anatoliy Karpoc
   https://stepik.org/course/76/syllabus - Part I
   https://stepik.org/course/524/info - Part II
   There are three chapter in there but since Part II the R is involved. You are free to skipp all the  practise parts and just absorb the theory. The teaching is good, really, but there are some people who find these courses bad: https://vk.com/@dmitry_penzar-stats-and-pulverization. Simply, author says that there are mistakes in fundamental concepts such as p-value or requrements for cental limit theorem
   
2. 'Статистика и котики'. Very short book about almost all concepts you need to Understand as data analyst or data scientist in extremely simple words. No formulas, no proofs, just naked idea. May be good, can be finished in 1 evening

3. 'Наглядная статистка' by Lagutin
   Tried to start several times but was overwhelmed. From the very first line it throws you directly to the statistics. No foreplays) 
   Comments from people: 'Это очень сложная книга и будет тяжела для новичков. Те кто смогу дойти до конца, пользу извлекут, но книга сложна'
   
Other resourses that i was recommended by other people:

Introduction to probabilitiy: Joseph_K_Blitzstein (Chapman and Hall text)
Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis: John A.Rice 
Introduction to R (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) - Course on Coursera, in R

4. StatQuest - youtube channel that explains statistics and not only it (in English) 
   super usefull

## 'Data analytics and Machine learning' Specialization from MIT and YANDEC on COURSERA
   https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-data-analysis#courses
   1. Math and Python for Data analysis
   2. Supervised learning
   3. Looking for structure in Data
   4. Making conclusions on Data
   5. Application of data analysis
   6. Capstone
   Overall the couse i good. Sometimes the theory is ovewhelming you and you feel like giving it up. The specializations mostly aimed on data analytics but it also covers some neural networks and computer vision stuff. Althought the 1 and 4 courses cover python and statistics concepts, is it better to take some additional course on Python and statistics as well

### There are 4 projects available there, I chose 'Clients churn rate prediction'


Now i need to study Combinatics and review some basic Probability theory to solve interview problems
