# hello-world
just practising git
My name is Vitaliy. I am data analyst and want to start using Git. I am not doing any coding except my jupyter notebooks for data analysis, i want to keep em all in here

Here i want to keep my personal roadmap: courses, videos, books, project and so on
I think it is the good way to structurize all the information i have absorbed during my study
