# hello-world
just practising git
My name is Vitaliy. I am data analyst and want to start using Git. I am not doing any coding except my jupyter notebooks for data analysis, i want to keep em all in here

Here i want to keep my personal roadmap: courses, videos, books, project and so on
I think it is the good way to structurize all the information i have absorbed during my study

## SQL section
1. I have already accomplished free course on Stepik.org called 'Интерактивный тренажор по SQL'
   https://stepik.org/cert/905950
   The course is based on the following principle: less theory, more practise
   Each section starts from the introduction of Database (you explore what tables are in there, what columns they have and so on)
   Then lesson by lesson you learn from Select to some Window functions.
   It's good that course is full of exercises but after i finished i realized: i know how to solve, but for some methods i have poor understanding of how it works. Still it was usefull. Comment section is very helpful: people who also studied this course come up with some interesting queries and you are free to try them all.
2. Currently i am trying SQL tutorial by MODE
   (https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/introduction-to-sql/)
   It is free text tutorial of SQl by MODE. The course is devided by 4 sections: basic, intermediate, advaced and analytics training.
   Mode offer you their own platform (like text editor). It already has all the databases you need, so you can freely practise exersices there, run your queries and check results. Also you can check the solution as well.
